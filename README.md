Course: Introduction to Big data  
Student: KALIZA NATASHA PEACE 
Instructor: Eric Maniraguha  
Date: 5th August 2025


##  Project Overview

This project uses livestock and meat international trade data to build a simple monitoring system.  
The goal is to analyze trade volumes to detect patterns that could indicate livestock health risks, outbreaks, or unusual trends.

  Deliverables

- Python Script: 'clean_livestock.py' for cleaning the dataset.
- Jupyter Notebook:'clean_livestock.ipynb' with step-by-step cleaning.
- **Power BI Dashboard: Visualizes trade volumes, trends, and key indicators.
- **Dataset:** 'Livestock_and_Meat_International_Trade.csv.xls' (raw) + 'livestock_cleaned.csv' (cleaned).
- PowerPoint: Screenshots & explanation of the whole process.

##  Key Insights

- Trade volume trends by year
- Seasonal variations
- Potential anomalies for health monitoring

##  How to Run

1. Run 'clean_livestock.py' or open 'clean_livestock.ipynb' to clean raw data.
2. Load 'livestock_cleaned.csv' into Power BI.
3. Open the '.pbix' dashboard to view visuals.
